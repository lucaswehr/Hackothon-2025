You will first be prompted to either add a shape, a line, or color a single cell.
- After answering the prompt you will choose a Marker (Key M), consisting of a symbol and color.
- If you choose to add a shape, you will use your cursor to find a center point, then enter other values required for the shape.
- If you choose to draw a line, you will choose two points with your cursor, which will then be connected.
- If you decide to fill a single cell, you wil use your cursor to select a singular cell.
